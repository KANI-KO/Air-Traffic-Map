# Real-Time Flight Tracking Over Japan

## Overview

This project lets you track live flights over Japan (or anywhere you want) in real-time, both the Jupyter Notebook and the Python script version are available. It also includes a boundary test for checking mapping areas using Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- **Real-Time Flight Data**: Flight data fetched from OpenSkyAPI, including aircraft info, call sign, origin_country, velocity, and altitude.
- **Interactive Map**: geographical world map using folium 
- **Airport Markers**: Red dots for the locations of all major airports in Japan, hover over for Airport Code.
- **Automatic Refresh**: Configurable refresh rate to update the map with the latest flight info.

**Clone This Repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/william-suu/Air-Traffic-Map.git
   ```

**Run It**:
   - **Jupyter Notebook Version**: Open the Jupyter notebook (`Air Traffic Map.ipynb`) and run all the cells to start watching planes in action!
   - **Python Script Version**: Run the Python script (`Air Traffic Map.py`) to generate the real-time flight map saved as an HTML file (`flight_map.html`). Open the file in your web browser to view the map.

- **Map Boundary Display**: This is a Jupyter Notebook (`Map Boundary Display.ipynb`) that lets you visualize the region created by your set coordinates.

## Future Ideas

- **Web Version**: Wouldn’t it be cool to make this a webpage?
- **Store Flight Data**: Save historical data for air traffic analysis.
- **flight path tracking**: tracing flight paths of planes over time.
